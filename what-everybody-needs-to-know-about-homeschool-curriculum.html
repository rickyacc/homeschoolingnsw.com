Each homeschool curriculum is designed to meet different needs.</p>

                <p>Your child has a particular way of learning and you have a desired way of teaching. The goal is to match your curriculum to meet each of your needs. For example, if your child is a visual learner, purchase a curriculum that includes pictures and photographs along with the written words.</p>

                <p>Many companies offer complete homeschooling curriculum packages. You can purchase an entire year of books, workbooks and teaching aids from one place. However, do not feel that you are locked into using one curriculum from one company. You can select subjects from different publishers and put them together for one complete year of study for your child. Much of this comes from years of experience as you may find you enjoy one publisher's math books, but do not like their language program. On that note, do not fret if you have purchased a book that does not work for you and your child. Try to sell it or donate it to another homeschooling family who may have better luck.</p>

                <p>Your religious beliefs may also dictate which curriculum you purchase. Some companies will use Christian story problems in their math courses and include scriptures in their language learning. If you are not comfortable with this, search for a secular-based program.</p>

                <p>Another key to your homeschool success is to familiarise yourself with your state government's homeschooling requirements. There has been much change of recent times regarding state government regulations for homeschooling. Do your research to ensure the curriculum meets their standards.</p>

                <p>Your homeschooling choice is a commendable one and you will never regret spending that time with your children. Take your time when selecting a curriculum, but do not feel locked into it once you have made a purchase. It is okay to switch halfway through the year if the study is not working for you. As the years continue, you will get more comfortable and confident in your choices and the years will pass smoothly by.</p>
