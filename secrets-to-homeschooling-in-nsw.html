                <p><img src="img/post-images/empty-classroom.jpg" alt="Empty Classroom" title="Empty Classroom" class="col-md-4 col-xs-6"  /><p>If you are a mum who is considering homeschooling in NSW, here are some important things to remember, along with one&nbsp;secret.</p>

                <h2>Why Home School in NSW? </h2>

                <p>It can be a difficult decision to choose whether or not to send your child to school or to educate them at home. While there are certainly advantages for doing each kind of schooling, there are many reasons mums in NSW choose to home school.</p>

                <p>Some mums choose to educate their child at home because they understand not all children learn the same way. Homeschooling offers a way to personalise their child's education and to use the style of learning that suits them best. It also allows your child to have one-on-one time with their instructor, who happens to be you. This can be especially advantageous when there are large class sizes and students fail to get the individual attention they need. By homeschooling your child, you can ensure they will get all the attention and help they need and deserve.</p>

                <h2>Am I Qualified to Home School My Child? </h2>

                <p>This is a question many mums ask themselves. They might think because they have no formal teaching qualifications, they won't be able to home school or the government won't let them. Both of these statements could not be further from the truth.</p>

                <p>Homeschooling is perfectly legal in every state in Australia. In order to legally home school your child, you simply register with the <a href="http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/home-schooling/index.html">Board of Studies, Teaching and Educational Standards NSW (BOSTES)</a>.</p>

                <p>Many mums who home school realise they are continuing what they have already begun during their child's first years of life, which is to help them hone necessary life skills. While teaching them to read will be different than potty training, the concept is still the same. You will simply continue to guide and help them in attaining important life skills while adding other subjects to the mix.</p>

                <p>Since there is no shortage of support for homeschooling parents and teachers, you won't have to worry about doing it alone. There are many other homeschooling NSW mums along with numerous workshops and conferences to attend. Both the library and Internet offer great resources as well.</p>

                <p>While these are all great reasons to home school, probably the most important secret is simply having the desire to do it.</p>
