            <p>In the modern world, there are several reasons why parents may want to homeschool their children.&nbsp; Some don't trust their children's peers or even the education system itself, yet the parents themselves may lack the time or patience to give their children what they deserveâ€”a good education.&nbsp; For those parents, cyber school may be an ideal alternative.</p>

            <p>Cyber School (or virtual school) is a modern alternative to receiving an education from home.&nbsp; It is all completely accessible from your personal computer, where your child can receive an education under an accredited academic program that they will need to carry on to the next grade or for graduation.</p>

            <p>While not every household has a stay-at-home parent, those who do may find cyber schooling a great convenience and a fitting scenario for both you and your child.</p>

            <p>Often times when our children are at school and doing poorly we may not find out until letters are sent home or conferences are held.&nbsp; By this time, the child feels buried under their work, and as a result they fall even further behind as they struggle to play catch-up.&nbsp; With your child attending cyber school from home, you are right there at those opportunities where your child may need some one-on-one guidance rather than being one of many in a classroom setting.&nbsp; When done with love and patience, being an intimate part of your child's learning experience helps build your relationship and your child's confidence.</p>

            <p>Though some cyber schools are fully independent and self-paced, others, like K12, offer a virtual experience with teacher-facilitated classes where the student keeps in contact with their teachers through email or programs offered by the school.</p>

            <p>While the many wooden desks, chalkboard, and ringing alarms may be absent, most of these cyber schools do utilize physical copies of books as well as other materials needed in classes like science.&nbsp; And for those parents who are concerned regarding your child's social life.&nbsp; Your town, no doubt, hosts several extracurricular programs including sports, boy scouts, and clubs among others.&nbsp; Children make friends fairly easily and they'll have phone numbers in no time to call and make plans for the weekend.&nbsp;</p>
