                <p>The term home schooling can strike fear in the hearts of many mums and dads. The very idea of taking on such a huge responsibility sounds dauntless to say the least. However, when compared to the many other courageous things that mums and dads do for their kids throughout the year, it isn't really any more intimidating than say, giving birth! Parents are super heroes and home schooling can be just another of your super powers.</p>

                <h2>Stress-Free Home Schooling?</h2>

                <p>So you can home school, and you may already be home schooling, but are you <a href="http://www.thebettermom.com/blog/2013/09/19/10-tips-for-a-stress-free-homeschool-day" target="_blank">stress-free home schooling</a>? Actually there is no such thing as stress-free home schooling just as there is no such thing as stress-free parenting. These little beings are solely your responsibility and their success or failure greatly depends partly on you, no stress? I don't think so. Even though&nbsp;there is no such thing as 'stress-free' home schooling there certainly can be 'stress reduced' home schooling. Here are a few tips on how to reduce the stress in home schooling so you can, and your kids can, learn more and enjoy more.</p>

                <h2>Stop Comparing</h2>

                <p>Do not compare yourself and your family to other homeschoolers. There will always be a family that seems more organised, more on schedule, more productive or even (let's admit it) more well behaved.&nbsp;That is okay. They are home schooling in a way that works for them. If they are home schooling joyfully, more power to them, but their way may not work for your family.</p>

                <p>Spend one entire day pretending that you and your family are the only home schooling family on earth. There is no one else to compare yourself to, no one's expectations to meet except your own. At the end of the day write down how you spent the day. What worked? What didn't work? Develop your own brand of home schooling that brings joy and peace to your particular family.</p>

                <h2>Stop Cramming</h2>

                <p>There is no law that says your <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2013/10/18/3872392.htm" target="_blank">home schooling family</a> must be involved in every home schooling activity on the planet, or every extracurricular activity on the planet. Activities are great, and your kids will need them in order to get some social interaction outside of home, but keep it within reason. When you let&nbsp;the activities take over then you are reduced to nothing more than a chauffeur and you and your kids will be very stressed with the intense schedule. Pick a few really meaningful activities that your kids can feel passionate about. If your kids are passionate about lots of things then rotate each year or by the season so that they are not trying to cram everything in at once.</p>

                <h2>Slow Down</h2>

                <p>Home school parents are typically&nbsp;already a little on the defensive side, because they fear that everyone is judging their choice to educate their children differently. Some people are judgmental, but do not let this turn into a tendency to overcompensate by pushing your children into being 'trophy kids' either academically or in sports and other activities. Home schooling is not a race, nor is it a competition. It is an alternate educational pathway&nbsp;in which spending time with your children is put in first place. Do not rush your children, and push your children so hard that after they graduate you hardly remember what you&nbsp;did together.</p>

                <p>Make memories, make messes, make mistakes, make masterpieces. Make each moment count.</p>
