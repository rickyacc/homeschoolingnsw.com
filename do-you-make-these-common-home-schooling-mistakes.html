                <p><img src="img/post-images/coloured-pencils-thumb.jpg" alt="Coloured Pencils" title="Coloured Pencils" class="col-md-4 col-xs-6"  />If you are one of the estimated 60,000&nbsp;Australian&nbsp;parents who have decided to home school your children you've probably completed extensive research on the best teaching methods and the different types of curriculum available. But no matter how prepared you may be there are often mistakes made when beginning the day to day process of educating your children. The following are four common home schooling mistakes parents often make.</p>

                <h2>1. Unrealistic Expectations</h2>

                <p>While fewer students and more one-on-one attention usually means that learning will take place at a quicker pace, you may still have unrealistic expectations. You shouldn't get nervous if your four-year-old isn't reading after a few weeks of instruction or if your eight-year-old isn't immediately fluent in a second language. Keeping expectations realistic also means not making comparisons to other children.</p>

                <h2>2. Lack of Organisation</h2>

                <p>Separating the school room from the living room isn't always easy when education is taking place at home. If at all possible, however, it's a good idea to have at least one room that is primarily used for learning. Supplies should be organised and kept in the same area where teaching will take place. A day at the beginning of each school year should be set aside for shopping for supplies and organising the learning area.</p>

                <h2>3. Not Taking Breaks</h2>

                <p>It can be tempting to try to rush through a school day as quickly as possible without much down time. There are studies confirming&nbsp;the idea that taking short breaks every 20 to 30 minutes will keep children&nbsp;refreshed and improve learning and memory. In fact, this is a common study tip for college students during exams. Students are encouraged to take regular breaks and then switch subjects to study to avoid burnout. It therefore makes sense that breaks would be even more beneficial for younger children.</p>

                <h2>4. Doing it All Alone</h2>

                <p>Teaching children at home can be overwhelming. This is especially true if there are several children of various ages in your family. Reaching out for assistance is not only a good idea but is usually necessary. There is now an extensive network of resources available for home learning. There is also a community of other home schoolers out there who have already been through the process. Churches and community groups can also offer a plethora of advice, support, and resources.</p>
